# Excel-Dashboard
The HR Analytics Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of employee attrition, shedding light on workforce turnover trends within the organization. Built using Microsoft Excel, the dashboard leverages pivot tables to derive critical KPIs from a dataset of 1,470 employees, enabling data-driven insights for strategic HR planning.

Key findings from the analysis show that 237 employees have exited the organization, resulting in an overall attrition rate of 16.12%.

At the core of the dashboard are intuitive visualizations that break down attrition patterns across multiple dimensions:

 Gender Analysis: Male employees display a higher attrition rate compared to females.

 Education Level: Employees holding Bachelor’s degrees represent the highest number of departures, with 99 exits.

 Job Roles: The roles of Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive are most affected by attrition, with 62 and 57 departures respectively.

Departmental Trends: The Research & Development (R&D) department shows the highest attrition, accounting for 56% of total exits.

 Age Group: Employees aged 25–34 are the most impacted, with 112 resignations observed in this age bracket.

##### To enhance interactivity and exploration, the dashboard includes slicers that allow users to filter data by education field, department, and gender. This dynamic feature equips HR teams with the tools to investigate attrition more deeply and develop targeted retention strategies based on specific workforce segments.
