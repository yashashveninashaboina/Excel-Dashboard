# HR-Analytics

The HR Analytics Dashboard provides a clear overview of employee attrition within the organization, helping to uncover patterns and trends in workforce turnover. Built using Microsoft Excel, the dashboard uses pivot tables and visual elements to highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) drawn from a dataset of 1,470 employees. From the analysis, it was observed that 237 employees have left the company, resulting in an overall attrition rate of 16.12%.

One of the strengths of this dashboard lies in its ability to break down attrition data across multiple categories. For example, the gender breakdown reveals that male employees have a slightly higher attrition rate compared to females. When looking at education levels, those with a Bachelor’s degree account for the highest number of exits, with 99 employees leaving.

Job role analysis points out that Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives are among the most affected, with 62 and 57 resignations respectively. In terms of department, Research & Development (R&D) shows the highest attrition contribution, making up about 56% of the total. Age-wise, employees in the 25–34 age bracket show the highest turnover, with 112 departures recorded.

To support interactive exploration, the dashboard includes slicers for filtering by education field, department, and gender. These interactive elements make it easier for HR teams to dive deeper into the data, uncover specific trends, and design more focused strategies to reduce attrition.
